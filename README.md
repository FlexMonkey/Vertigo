# Vertigo
Vertigo inducing colourful painting...

If, like me, you're old enough to remember the Vertigo logo spinning round on a Black Sabbath record, this may be the demo for you. This project was inspired by [seeing a video](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/03/a-spinning-mosaic-of-patterns-drawn-on-a-potters-wheel/) of artist Mikhail Sadovnikov making patterns in wet clay on a potter's wheel.

Simply touch the screen towards the centre to draw some vertigo inducing psychedelic spinning patterns!
